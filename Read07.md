# 1-The (table) element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row. 
# 2-The (tr) element used for new table row  , and (td) element used for filling the table .
#  3-The (th) element is used just like the (td) element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. 
# 4-The colspan attribute can be used on a (th) or (td) element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across. 
# 5-The rowspan attribute can be used on a (th) or (td) element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table. 
# 6-There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows ( thead , tbody , tfoot).
# 7-The value of a property can be a string, number, Boolean, array, or even another object. 
# 8-To update the value of properties , use dot notation or square brackets , to delete a property you can use the delete keyword .
# 9-Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things. Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects. First, create the template with the object's properties and method.
# 10-The keyword (this) is commonly used inside functions and objects. Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates. 
# 11-JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 

# 12-Arrays are actually a special type of object . They hold a related set of key/value pairs , but each value is its index number .
# 13-You can combine arrays and objects to create complex data structures , arrays can store a series of objects , and objects can also hold arrays .
# 14-These properties and methods are often used to work with text stored in variables or objects (toUpperCase (), ToLowerCase () ……. ).
# 15-Each character in a string is automatically given a number, called an index number. Index numbers always start at zero and not one .
#  16-The Math object has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions ,like (Math.floor , Math.random , Math.round ).
