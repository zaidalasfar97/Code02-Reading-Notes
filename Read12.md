# 3-The canvas element have two optional attributes (width , height ) .
# 4-You can use id and class attribute with it .
# 5-The canvas element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, backgroundâ€¦).
# 6-The canvas element requires the closing tag canvas.
# 7-If we want to apply colors to a shape, there are two important properties we can use: fillStyle and strokeStyle.
# 8-We can use (font , textAligin , textBaseline , direction ) properties to style the font .
