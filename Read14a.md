# 1-layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements.
# 2-The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional.
# 3-Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. 
# 4-Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis.
# 5-Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.
# 6-The default scale value is 1, therefore any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller while any value greater than or equal to 1.01 makes an element appear larger.
# 7-The scaleX value will scale the width of an element while the scaleY value will scale the height of an element.
# 8-Skew is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both.
# 9-There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.
# 10-The transition-timing-function property is used to set the speed in which a transition will move.
# 11-Having things fade in is a fairly common request from clients. Itâ€™s a great way to emphasize functionality or draw attention to a call to action .
# 12-Animating a change of color used to be unbelievably complex, with all kinds of math involved in calculating separate RGB values and then recombining them.
# 13-To grow an element, you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding
# 14-CSS transforms have a number of different uses, and one of the best is transforming the rotation of an element.
