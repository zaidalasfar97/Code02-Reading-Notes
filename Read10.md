# 1-Every statement in a script lives in one of three execution contexts (global context , fucntion context , eval context ).
# 2-Error objects can help you find where your mistakes are and browsers have tools to help you read them. 
# 3-Types of error objects (syntax error , reference error , type error , range error , URI error , eval error).
# 4-Syntax Error like mismatching or unclosed quotes, missing closing bracke, missing comma in array, malformed property name.
# 5-Type Error  like  incorrect case ,  method does not exist , dom node does not exist .
# 6-Range error like cannot arete array with -1 items .
# 7-There are two ways to deal with error ( debug the script to fix errors , handle errors gracefully ).
# 8-The JavaScript console will tell you when there is a problem with a script, where to look for the problem, and what kind of issue it seems to be. 
# 9-The JavaScript console is just one of several developer tools that are found in all modern browsers.
# 10-You can also just type code into the console and it will show you a result.
# 11-Browsers that have a console have a console object, which has several methods that your script can use to display data in the console. 
# 12-If you set multiple breakpoints, you can step through them one-by-one to see where values change and a problem might occur.
# 13-You can indicate that a breakpoint should be triggered only if a condition that you specify is met.
# 14-If you know your code might fail, use try, catch, and finally. Each one is given its own code block. 
# 15-If you know something might cause a problem for your script, you can generate your own errors before the interpreter creates them.
