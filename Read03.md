# 1-There are 3 type of list (ordered list , unordered. List ,definition list ) .
# 2- The ordered list is created with ( Ol ) tag .
# 3-The unordered list is created with ( Ul ) tag .
# 4-The definition list is created with (Dl) tag .
# 5-You can put second list inside an (li) tag, this called nested list .**
# 6- You can edit Box dlimeensions by width and height .
# 7- Min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow.
# 8-Max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.
# 9-You can use overflow property to tell the browser if the content contained within the box is larger than the box , you can have to value (hidden , scroll ).
# 10-You can edit border width by pixels .
# 11-You can edit border style (Solid , dotted , dashed , double , ridge ) , and you can edit border color .
# 12-Padding property allow to you how much space between the content and border .
# 13-Margin property allow to you have space between border and another border .
# 14-You can change the type of display the element by (display : inline ) or (display : block) or (display:hide ).
# 15-The visibility property allows you to hide boxes from users but It leaves a space where the element would have been.
# 16-You can add border to Images , and you can add shadows to images .**
# 17-An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
# 18-The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store a string, a number and a Boolean all in the same array.
# 19-Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).
# 20-The if statement checks a condition if the condition goes true will run the code in side curly brace.
# 21-The if else statement checks a condition , if it resolves to rue the first code block is executed ,if the condition resolves to false the.  Second code block is run instead .
# 22-Switch statements starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
# 23-Switch statements should have default option , that default run if none of cases match.
# 24-Type coercion : convert data types behind the scenes to complete an operation.
# 25-Loops check a condition , if it returns true , until the condition return false .
# 26-3 type of loops (For , while , do while ).
# 27-Statment made from three condition .
# 28-While loop , in code block there are two statement .
