# 1-Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. 
# 2-The value of a property can be a string, number, Boolean, array, or even another object. 
# 3-Literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects .
# 4-You access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation , you can also access properties using square brackets .
# 5-The document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 
# 6-he opening tags of HTML elements can carry attributes and these are represented by attribute nodes in the DOM tree. 
# 7-Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps: 1: Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with. 2: Use its text content, child elements, and attributes. 
# 8-DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist, which is a collection of nodes. 
# 9-getElementbyId() and querySelector () can both search an entire document and return individual elements , both use a similar syntax .
# 10-The getElementbyId() is the quickest and most efficient way to access an element because no two elements can share the same value for their id attribute .
# 11-The querySelector () is very flexible because its parameters is a CSS selector , which means it can be used to accurately target many more elements .
# 12- When a DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a Nodelist (even if it only finds one matching element). 
# 13-A Nodelist is a collection of element nodes. Each node is given an index number (a number that starts at zero, just like an array). 
# 14-There are two ways to select an element from a Nodelist: The item() method and array syntax. Both require the index number of the element you want. 
# 15-When you have an element node, you can select another element in relation to it using these five properties. This is known as traversing the DOM. 
# 16-Traversing the DOM can be difficult because some browsers add a text node whenever they come across whitespace between elements. 
# 17-From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and innerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques. 
# 18-An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
